<!-- 
    After importing angular the file we should be importing is our app.js 
    file. This file is where we instantiate our angular application as well
    as pass in our dependencies. For this assignment we will only be injecting 
    ng router.

    Make sure that as you add new controllers and factories, that we must include
    a script tag for each one.
